# IoT-Composter-Project
Decomposition is the process by which organic substances such as bio-waste from the kitchen convert to simpler organic matter such as carbon dioxide, water, simple sugars and mineral salts etc.  [wikipedia] Nevertheless, the process of decomposition not only requires certain conditions, but also it is a long process in order to reach conditional requirements at some points. 
In our project, we are planning to utilize the internet technology, Microcontroller, sensors and programming skills to create a smart decomposition system that can most possibly simulate all the necessary requirements to catalyze the decomposition process. 

The purpose of this project is to design a smart system for those people who have zero-experience in decomposing processes  (anyone) to conduct decomposition much more efficiently and effectively. 

##Web UI:

Web UI should provide the certain key information / statistics for bio-waste already in the box, the possible key information as follows:

Days or duration of first bio-waste in the box
Temperature figure - perhaps with heating pad if needed (optional)
Humidity figure
Emptiness - indicates how much bio-waste has been left in the box

Functionality of Web UI:
Display those information on live mode
Alert the end user about current situation in the box in order to change (end user is kind of actuator in the whole process)
Activate actuator like heating pad when cold temperature (optional)


##Embedded Components:

For embedded systems, LCD should indicate the certain key figures and leds (red, green, blue) should provide visible warning which should be the same as the web ui display. 

###Sensors:
-temperature sensor
-humidity sensor (or moisture sensor)
-Ultrasonic sensor

###Prototype Material:
-Pvc material?
-Glass
-Styrofoam

###Components:
Oled display
Rasperrybi pico_w
Wires and socket (Battery for prototype)
leds
